[Bear](https://bear.app) is a macOS and iOS application designed for one thing: note taking. It's like [Evernote](https://evernote.com/), but without the bloat.

There aren't a lot of whizbang features in Bear. Instead, Bear consistently delivers on all of its promises. Tags, search, and syncing all work flawlessly. The application is intuitive, and that's exactly what you want when you're taking notes.

Bear doesn't automatically enable support Markdown by default, but you can [enable it in the preferences](#enabling-markdown-support). The application has a hybrid live editor and text editor â€” you can see both the Markdown syntax and the way the formatting changes the text. It takes a while to get used to, but it's useful if you're just getting started with Markdown.

### Enabling Markdown Support

To enable Markdown support in Bear, open the Preferences window. On the **General** tab, turn on the setting for **Markdown compatibility mode**.

<div class="alert alert-success">
  <i class="fas fa-lightbulb"></i> <strong>Tip:</strong> If you're using Bear on more than one device, you'll need to enable the Markdown compatibility mode setting on all of your devices.
</div>

### Support for Additional Syntax Elements

As an added bonus, Bear provides support for several obscure elements.

<table class="table table-bordered" style="font-size: 14px">
  <thead class="thead-light">
    <tr>
      <th>Element</th>
      <th>Markdown</th>
      <th>Rendered Output</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Highlight</td>
      <td><code>::word or phrase::</code></td>
      <td><mark>word or phrase</mark></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Underline</td>
      <td><code>~word or phrase~</code></td>
      <td><u>word or phrase</u></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
