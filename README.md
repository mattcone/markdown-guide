# Markdown Guide

[![Build Status](https://github.com/mattcone/markdown-guide/workflows/tests/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/mattcone/markdown-guide/actions)

*[The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org)* is a comprehensive Markdown reference designed for both novices and experts. It was born out of frustration with existing Markdown references that are incomplete and inadequate.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. Feel free to open a pull request with changes.

### Running it Locally

It can be helpful to preview changes on your computer before opening a pull request. *The Markdown Guide* uses the [Jekyll static site generator](http://jekyllrb.com/). After forking or cloning the repository, perform the following steps to generate the site and preview it:

- Make sure you have ruby installed on your computer. See https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/
- `bundle install`
- `bundle exec jekyll serve`
- Point your browser at http://127.0.0.1:4000/

### Adding tools

See [this page](https://github.com/mattcone/markdown-guide/wiki/Markdown-tool-directory) for information about adding applications to the [Markdown tools directory](https://www.markdownguide.org/tools/).
