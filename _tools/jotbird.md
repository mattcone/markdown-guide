*Full disclosure: JotBird was created by the author of The Markdown Guide.*

JotBird is a clean, privacy-focused live Markdown editor that runs entirely in your web browser. Unlike feature-heavy editors, JotBird is designed for simplicity: you type Markdown on the left and see a real-time rendered preview on the right, with no account creation, no cookies, and no tracking. The editor automatically saves your draft locally in your browser, so there’s nothing to install and nothing stored on a server unless you choose to publish a document. The interface is minimal, fast, and approachable, making it an easy option for both beginners and experienced Markdown users who want a distraction-free writing environment.

JotBird supports a wide range of Markdown features, including GitHub-style tables, task lists, strikethrough, emoji shortcodes, footnotes, and syntax highlighting in fenced code blocks. Images can be pasted directly into the editor and are uploaded automatically when you publish. Published documents receive a unique, shareable URL and expire after 30 days. The tool is intentionally lightweight and doesn’t include file management, plugin systems, or export templates, which keeps it easy to use but may limit power users who need more advanced workflows. Still, for quick notes, writing drafts, documentation snippets, and sharing Markdown-formatted content online, JotBird offers an elegant and privacy-friendly solution.
