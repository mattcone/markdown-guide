With Markdown, [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com) text formatting is a breeze. All Reddit users have the option of writing comments and posts in Markdown. The popular news website has developed its own Markdown processor called "snoomark" which is based on GitHub-Flavored Markdown. Some have started referring to this as "Reddit-flavored Markdown." For a deep dive into Reddit's Markdown support, see [this wiki article](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/markdown).

### Enabling Markdown Support

By default, Reddit disables Markdown support for new posts and comments. You can switch from the rich text editor to Markdown by clicking the **Switch to markdown** link, as shown below.

<img src="/assets/images/tools/reddit.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Switching to Markdown on Reddit.com" style="width:80%;">

To permanently save this setting, you can enable the **Default to Markdown** setting in **User Settings** > **Feed Settings**. Enabling that setting will automatically enable Markdown for new posts or comments.

{% include tool-syntax-table.html %}

### Support for Additional Syntax Elements

As an added bonus, Reddit provides support for several obscure elements.

<table class="table table-bordered" style="font-size: 14px">
  <thead class="thead-light">
    <tr>
      <th>Element</th>
      <th>Markdown</th>
      <th>Rendered Output</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Spoilers</td>
      <td><code>This text will be hidden: >!spoilers!<</code></td>
      <td></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Superscript</td>
      <td><code>The greatest thing you'll ever learn is just to ^reddit and be ^(reddited here) in return.</code></td>
      <td>The greatest thing you'll ever learn is just to <sup>reddit</sup> and be <sup>reddited here</sup> in return.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
