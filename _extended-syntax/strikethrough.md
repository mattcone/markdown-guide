You can strikethrough words by putting a horizontal line through the center of them. The result looks ~~like this~~. This feature allows you to indicate that certain words are a mistake not meant for inclusion in the document. To strikethrough words, use two tilde symbols (`~~`) before and after the words.

```
~~The world is flat.~~ We now know that the world is round.
```

The rendered output looks like this:

~~The world is flat.~~ We now know that the world is round.
