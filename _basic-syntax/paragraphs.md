### Paragraph Best Practices

Unless the [paragraph is in a list](/basic-syntax/#paragraphs), don't indent paragraphs with spaces or tabs.

<table class="table table-bordered">
  <thead class="thead-light">
    <tr>
      <th>✅&nbsp; Do this</th>
      <th>❌&nbsp; Don't do this</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <code class="highlighter-rouge">
          Don't put tabs or spaces in front of your paragraphs.<br><br>

          Keep lines left-aligned like this.<br><br>
        </code>
      </td>
      <td>
        <code class="highlighter-rouge">
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This can result in unexpected
        formatting problems.<br><br>

        &nbsp;&nbsp;Don't add tabs or spaces in front of paragraphs.
        </code>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
