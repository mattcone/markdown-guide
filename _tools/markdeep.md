[Markdeep](https://casual-effects.com/markdeep) is a free and simple tool that turns any Markdown file into a self-contained HTML file that can be viewed in a web browser. There's nothing to install and there's no service to register for â€” you simply add one line of code to the bottom of your Markdown file. This is a great option if you need to quickly view a Markdown file in a web browser or share a Markdown file with someone who needs to view the rendered output.

Using Markdeep is a three-part process:

1. Add the following tag for Markdeep on a single line at the bottom of a Markdown file.

    `<!-- Markdeep: --><style class="fallback">body{visibility:hidden;white-space:pre;font-family:monospace}</style><script src="markdeep.min.js" charset="utf-8"></script><script src="https://casual-effects.com/markdeep/latest/markdeep.min.js" charset="utf-8"></script><script>window.alreadyProcessedMarkdeep||(document.body.style.visibility="visible")</script>`

2. Rename the Markdown file to add the `.md.html` extension (i.e., `myfile.md.html`).
3. Open the file in a web browser to see the rendered output.

This tool has a lot of features beyond what's described here. For instance, you can choose from a variety of templates to customize the look of your page. Markdeep also supports diagrams, LaTeX typesetting for equations, and much more. Check out the excellent [documentation](https://casual-effects.com/markdeep) for the full details.
