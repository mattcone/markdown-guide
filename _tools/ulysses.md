[Ulysses](https://ulysses.app) is a popular writing application for macOS and iOS devices. Lauded by journalists and reviewers, Ulysses provides lots of useful features and nice touches for people who write professionally. The theming and export options are second to none.

Unfortunately, using Ulysses to write in Markdown is an exercise in frustration. The application supports a subset of the Markdown syntax, but support for many syntax elements is notably absent. Even worse, support for some elements is provided using non-standard notation. Ulysses might not be your first choice if you're wanting to write exclusively in Markdown.

### Support for Additional Syntax Elements

As an added bonus, Ulysses provides support for several obscure elements.

<table class="table table-bordered" style="font-size: 14px">
  <thead class="thead-light">
    <tr>
      <th>Element</th>
      <th>Markdown</th>
      <th>Rendered Output</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Highlight</td>
      <td><code>::word or phrase::</code></td>
      <td><mark>word or phrase</mark></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
