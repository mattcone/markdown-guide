# Markdown Guide

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mattcone/markdown-guide.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mattcone/markdown-guide)

[The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org) is a comprehensive Markdown reference designed for novice and intermediate users. It was born out of frustration with existing Markdown references that are incomplete, inadequate, or both.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. Feel free to open a pull request with changes.

### Running it Locally

- Make sure you have ruby installed on your computer. See https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/
- `bundle install`
- `jekyll serve`
- Point your browser at http://127.0.0.1:4000/

## Deployment

Pull requests merged to the master branch are automatically deployed to the production website.

[Markdown 가이드](https://www.markdownguide.org)는 초보자와 중급 사용자를 위해 설계된 포괄적 인 Markdown 참조 문서입니다. 그것은 불완전하거나 부적절한 기존 Markdown 참고 문헌에 대한 좌절감에서 태어났습니다.
