You can organize items into ordered and unordered lists.

{% include syntax.html type="basic-sub" syntax-id="ordered-lists" %}

{% include syntax.html type="basic-sub" syntax-id="unordered-lists" %}

### Adding Elements in Lists

To add another element in a list while preserving the continuity of the list, indent the element four spaces or one tab, as shown in the following examples.

#### Paragraphs

```
*   This is the first list item.
*   Here's the second list item.

    I need to add another paragraph below the second list item.

*   And here's the third list item.
```

The rendered output looks like this:

*   This is the first list item.
*   Here's the second list item.

    I need to add another paragraph below the second list item.

*   And here's the third list item.

#### Blockquotes

```
*   This is the first list item.
*   Here's the second list item.

    > A blockquote would look great below the second list item.

*   And here's the third list item.
```

The rendered output looks like this:

*   This is the first list item.
*   Here's the second list item.

    > A blockquote would look great below the second list item.

*   And here's the third list item.

#### Code Blocks {#code-blocks-1}
