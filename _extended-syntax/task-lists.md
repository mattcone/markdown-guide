Task lists (also referred to as *checklists* and *todo* lists) allow you to create a list of items with checkboxes. In Markdown applications that support task lists, checkboxes will be displayed next to the content. To create a task list, add dashes (`-`) and brackets with a space (`[ ]`) in front of task list items. To select a checkbox, add an `x` in between the brackets (`[x]`).
