You can organize items into ordered and unordered lists. Indent items with four spaces.

{% include syntax.html type="basic-sub" syntax-id="ordered-lists" %}

{% include syntax.html type="basic-sub" syntax-id="unordered-lists" %}

### Adding Elements in Lists

To add another element in a list while preserving the continuity of the list, indent the element four spaces or one tab, as shown in the following examples.

<div class="alert alert-success">
  <i class="fas fa-lightbulb"></i> <strong>Tip:</strong> If things don't appear the way you expect, double check that you've indented the elements in the list four spaces or one tab.
</div>

#### Paragraphs

```
* This is the first list item.
* Here's the second list item.

    I need to add another paragraph below the second list item.

* And here's the third list item.
```

The rendered output looks like this:

* This is the first list item.
* Here's the second list item.

    I need to add another paragraph below the second list item.

* And here's the third list item.

#### Blockquotes

```
* This is the first list item.
* Here's the second list item.

    > A blockquote would look great below the second list item.

* And here's the third list item.
```

The rendered output looks like this:

* This is the first list item.
* Here's the second list item.

    > A blockquote would look great below the second list item.

* And here's the third list item.
