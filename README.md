[The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org) is a concise introduction to Markdown designed for novice and intermediate users. It was born out of frustration with existing Markdown references that are needlessly verbose.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. Feel free to open a pull request with changes.

### Running it Locally

It can be helpful to preview changes on your computer before opening a pull request. The *Markdown Guide* uses the [Jekyll static site generator](http://jekyllrb.com/). After forking or cloning the repository, perform the following steps to generate the site and preview it:

- Make sure you have ruby installed on your computer. See https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/
- `bundle install`
- `jekyll serve`
- Point your browser at http://127.0.0.1:4000/

## Deployment

Pull requests merged to the master branch are automatically deployed to the production website.
